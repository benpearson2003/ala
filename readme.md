The Name
Leuconotopicus borealis, the red-cockaded woodpecker, is an endangered species in Arkansas.
It's named after the small red streak on each side of the male's black cap.

Purpose
Replacement for the current ASP.NET/C# arklegaudit.gov.

Technology
Uses Laravel, PHP, Javascript, and MySQL. The server is Apache. Unlike
the current setup, a compiler is unnecessary. LAMP will make the site
more responsive to changing technologies through a better development
community and more readable code.
